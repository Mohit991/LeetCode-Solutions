# We create one zigZag list which will contain lists. 
# Each row of this list will contain string at that index in the 
# zigzag string. 

# we keep a direction flag to know if we are going downwards or 
# upwards. direction == true means downwards otherwise upwards. 
# We will add chars from s into the correct row of the zigZag. 
# We determine our direction in zigZag using the var direction. 
# We change the direction when we reach 0 or len(zigZag)

# At the end we simply collect all the rows from zigZag into 
# the ans.
