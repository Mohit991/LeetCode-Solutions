# Take the number and remove 2 from it by dividing repeatedly by 2
# Now divide repeadtly by 3 and remove 3 from it as well. 
# Then do the same for 5.
# If the remaining number becomes 1 that means the only prime factors were 2, 3 and 5
# Since by dividing by 2, 3 and 5, the number has become 1, it is ugly
# If it is not 1 that means there are other factors as well, then we will return
# false, meaning it is not ugly.
