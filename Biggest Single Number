-- use COALESCE 
-- Evaluates the arguments in order and returns the current value of 
-- the first expression that initially doesn't evaluate to NULL. 
-- For example, SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, 'third_value', 
-- 'fourth_value'); returns the third value because the 
-- third value is the first value that isn't null.
