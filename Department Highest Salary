-- We can write an inner query to get max salary department wise. 
-- After that we can use that result and join it with employee and department
-- to get department name, employee name and max salary. 

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
select d.name Department, emp.name Employee, temp.salary Salary from 
(select dept.id as deptid, max(emp.salary) as salary
from employee emp inner join department dept

inner join employee emp on emp.departmentId = temp.deptid
and temp.salary = emp.salary
inner join Department d on d.id = temp.deptid
