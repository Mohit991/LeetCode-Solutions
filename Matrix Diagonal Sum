# We just need to look at the index of the diagonals. 
# Primary diagonal in a n sqaure matrix looks like: mat[0][0], mat[1][1], ..., mat[n][n]
# Secondary diagonal looks like: mat[0][n], mat[1][n-1], mat[2][n-1], ..., mat[n][0]
# We also need to avoid the cells which we included in primary diagonal calculations, 
# in secondary diagonal calculations.
