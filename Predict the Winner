# Let's build the search tree first, take nums = [3, 2, 4] for example,

#  [3,2,4]
#    3/\4---------- 1st player's decision
# [2,4] [3,2]
# 2/ \4  3/ \2----- 2nd player's decision
# [4][2] [2][3]

# currently 1st with choosable i, j,
#1.if 1st picks nums[i], 2nd can pick either ends of nums[i + 1, j]
 #a.if 2nd picks nums[i + 1], 1st can pick either ends of nums[i + 2, j]
 #b.if 2nd picks nums[j], 1st can pick either ends of nums[i + 1, j - 1]
 #since 2nd plays to maximize his score, 1st can get nums[i] + min(1.a, 1.b)
 #We take  min(1.a, 1.b) because second player also plays his best and takes max(1.a, 1.b)
 #And we are left with  min(1.a, 1.b)

#2.if 1st picks nums[j], 2nd can pick either ends of nums[i, j - 1]
 #a.if 2nd picks nums[i], 1st can pick either ends of nums[i + 1, j - 1];
 #b.if 2nd picks nums[j - 1], 1st can pick either ends of nums[i, j - 2];
 #since 2nd plays to maximize his score, 1st can get nums[j] + min(2.a, 2.b)
        
#since the 1st plays to maximize his score, 1st can get max(nums[i] + min(1.a, 1.b), nums[j] + min(2.a, 2.b));

# TC with memoization = O(2^n)
# After memoization = O(n^2), SC: O(n)

#Another approch:
# If you pick the ith then you score = nums[i]
# Opponents score = scoring(i+1, j)
# because opponent now has the next move
# Your gain = nums[i] - scoring(i+1, j)
# Since we are only going to calculate if p1 can get a +ve score,
# if it can then he can win. 

# If you pick the jth then you score = nums[j]
# Opponents score = scoring(i, j-1)
# because opponent now has the next move
# Your gain = nums[j] - scoring(i, j-1)
# Since we are only going to calculate if p1 can get a +ve score,
# if it can then he can win. 

# We return the max we can get by picking ith or jth.
